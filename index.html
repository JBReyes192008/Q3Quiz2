	<td>A greek mythological demi-god who was given a task called the 12 labors. These 12 labors were given to him to atone for his sins. And was tasked to kill animals and conquer other villages.
</td>
	<td>Dwayne Johnson, Ingrid Bolso Berdal, Ian Mcshane, Irina Shayk are the main characters of the movie</td>
	<td>I am fascinated by Greek Mythology, especially the creatures. And I have seen four movies about Greek Mythology, but now, this one shall stand right alongside "Percy Jackson: The Lightening Thief" as one of my favorite movies about Greek Mythology. Brett Ratner's "Hercules." Right from the get-go, I was instantly engrossed as my ears were gripped by the dramatic narration by Reece Ritchie, telling the backstory of our titular hero. Then, we are introduced to our heroes in one action scene - Kyle Vansteelandt</td>

</td>
	<td>Keanu Reeves (John Constantine), Rachel Weisz (Angela Dodson), Tilda Swinton (Gabriel), Peter Stomare (Lucifer) are the main actors and characters of the movie</td>
	<td>The irony in the poor response back in 2005 to DC Comics' and Warner Bros. film "Constantine" is that of this were released in today's oversaturated superhero/comic book film market, the critics would deem this film a masterpiece due to it not being the run-of-the-mill comic book movie - AJ Taylor</td>

    <td>The main characters are Keanu Reeves (John wick), Lance Reddick (Charon), Donnie Yen (Caine), Scott Adkins (Killa)</td>
    <td>Ever since the original John Wick, the franchise has set a standard of what action in Hollywood should be. Thanks to director Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. - Luke Rota</td>
